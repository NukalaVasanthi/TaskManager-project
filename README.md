# Task Manager CLI Application

## Project Description
The **Task Manager CLI Application** is a Python-based command-line tool that helps users manage their tasks directly from the terminal. It supports adding, viewing, deleting, and marking tasks as completed. Tasks are saved to a file for persistence, so users can pick up where they left off.

## Features
- **Add a Task**: Create a new task by providing a title. Each task is assigned a unique ID.
- **View Tasks**: List all tasks with their IDs and completion status (completed or not).
- **Delete a Task**: Remove a task from the list by specifying its ID.
- **Mark a Task as Completed**: Change a taskâ€™s status to indicate it is finished.
- **Save and Load Tasks**: Tasks are saved to `tasks.json` for persistence and are automatically loaded when the application starts.

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
